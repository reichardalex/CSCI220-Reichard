        <p> College students consume surprising quantities of caffeine on average. This study seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount of 
            caffeine an individual consumes daily and that individual's grade point average in school.</p>

    <p>The initial experiment included a group, which received daily caffeine equal to the national average (Group A), a group which received twice the 
            national daily average (Group B), and a control group which received a placebo (Group C). </p>

 
    <p> Preliminary results indicate that average consumption of daily caffeine led to a slight and steady increase in GPA throughout the term. A higher 
            than average consumption of caffeine led to higher GPA initially, but then grades fell off towards the end of the semester. Finally, no consumption of 
            caffeine led to neither a significant increase or decrease in overall GPA performance.</p>
