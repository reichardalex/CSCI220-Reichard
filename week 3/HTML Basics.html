        <p> College students consume surprising quantities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> on average. This study seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount of 
            caffeine an individual consumes daily and that individual's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">grade point average</a> in school.</p>

    <p>The initial experiment included a group, which received daily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> to the national average (Group A), a group which received twice the 
            national daily average (Group B), and a control group which received a placebo (Group C). </p>

 
    <p> Preliminary results indicate that average consumption of daily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> led to a slight and steady increase in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">GPA</a> throughout the term. A higher 
            than average consumption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> led to higher GPA initially, but then grades fell off towards the end of the semester. Finally, no consumption of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> led to neither a significant increase or decrease in overall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">GPA</a> performance.</p>

                <li>
                  100 students were selected from volunteer applicants between the ages of 18-22 years old, with equal numbers of female and male participants and 
                  with a starting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">GPA</a> between 3.2 and 3.3. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each student was assigned a number from 1-100
                </li>
                <li>
                  Numbers were then randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C
                </li>
                <li>
                  Group A was given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> equivalent to 3 cups of coffee per day (the national average)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Group B was given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> equivalent to 6 cups of coffee per day
                </li>
                <li>
                  Group C was given a placebo
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">Grade point averages</a> were tracked throughout the term and averaged by group at the start of the semester, at midterm, and after final grades
                   were submitted
                </li>
